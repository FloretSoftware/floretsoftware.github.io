Made for my "C++ For Games Engines" Module, I went with a slower pace stealth FPS. This was my most challenging module yet but I still persevere to make a great gameplay experience with it. I learnt about and used a multitude of things but most namely using C++ in unreal and all the interesting niches to make things unique for unreal.

Below is a demo video for the game:
