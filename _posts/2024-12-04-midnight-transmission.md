Midnight Transmission was a fan-game of the cult classic indie game Yume Nikki all about exploring esoteric and unique worlds and seeing how far the rabbithole goes.

I was part of the Core Dev/Lead Dev team which consisted of me and two other friends: Rat and [GiantBoar](https://giantboar.com/).

I created four of the playable levels (called worlds) for the game, handling their asset creation as well as implmentation, as well handled the code related to those worlds. Alongside this I helped with the ideation and community support of the game.

The project was created in Godot and the development was done through GitHub to assist in simulataneous development as well as tracking development through the issues tracker.

Alongside the core devs there was also a large amount of community contributions to the project from art to music to world to code.

This video shows the levels I created for the game.
