Chatterbox is the engine tool I made for my uni module "Tools Development". It is a node based dialogue creation system that allows for a hassle free way to implement dialogue into a unity game. It features many things such as branching dialogue, grouping of dialogue, saving/loading, error handling and many other features.

This was a unique challenge for me and I really enjoyed working on it and further cemented an admiration for tools creation for games.

This is a preview image of what the UI looks like:
